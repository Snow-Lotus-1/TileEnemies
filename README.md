# TileEnemies
An attempt to create the baisis of a tactical strategy rpg. The current version is highly unpolished and unfinished. The this current version is ment to share the pathfinding meathod I ended up using. Features like attacking are not implmented. All the features in this version realate to movement and enemy movement.
